## To-do
-	Selenium doesnâ€™t work
    o	The lobbyist profiles are delivered through ASP, so will likely require either Selenium or more advanced requests/urllib calls
-	How to check if page has been updated with new names (tracking names? Webpage changes?)
    o	Tracking names will require method of avoiding completely duplicate entries
    o	Page has a Total Records listing, comparison with existing file will likely be way forward, then do a simple substraction
- The rest of the provinces
